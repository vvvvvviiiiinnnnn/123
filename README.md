# Motion blur effect using SVG filters

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/damianmuti/pen/MvYPPa](https://codepen.io/damianmuti/pen/MvYPPa).

This is an experiment that simulates a motion blur effect every time a slide is switched. It takes advantage of SVG Gaussian Blur filter and some CSS keyframes animation.
Although the effect does not require any Javascript to properly work, in this example Javascript is only used for the slider functionality.

Disclaimer:
Only works on Chrome/Firefox.

CHANGELOG:

-Updated duration/speed based on @THEORLAN2 fork, which seemed more accurate based on the amount of blur. Kudos, mate!
